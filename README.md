## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
With the rapid popularization of the Internet and the development of film industry, the amount of movie information on the Internet is quite large, and people's demand for obtaining interesting movie information for entertainment is also increasing. Personalized movie recommendation systems have become a hot topic of discussion. The representation method of movie information is relatively complex, and various existing similarity calculation methods have their own advantages. The management of a large amount of movie data and user data also becomes increasingly complex as the amount of data increases. How to combine the advantages of various algorithms to give users reliable movie recommendation results and allow users to access correct recommendation data has become an important issue. 

This system uses crawler to crawl movie data on movie websites, and combines collaborative filtering algorithm, content-based recommendation method, statistics-based recommendation algorithm and other algorithms in the recommendation module, and combines offline recommendation to effectively solve the problem of system recommendation question of accuracy. In the project, the design and implementation of front-end visualization pages, back-end business processing, and algorithms are implemented, and movies that users may prefer are recommended.
